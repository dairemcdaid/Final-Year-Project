iOS heart rate tracking application.

Heart rate data trasnferred from a fitness watch using Apples Core Bluetooth framwork, to an iOS application.  
The data is stored and using the iOS Charts library, the heart rate information is displayed using a line chart.
Firebase Authentication was used to add a layer of security to the app, by providing an email/password sign up.
